The [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) (/ˈmændəlbrɒt/) is the set of complex numbers (c) for which the function (f(z) = z^2+c) does not diverge when iterated from z=0, i.e., for which the sequence fc(0),fc(fc(0)), etc., remains bounded in absolute value. Its definition is credited to Adrien Douady who named it in tribute to the mathematician [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot), a pioneer of fractal geometry.
